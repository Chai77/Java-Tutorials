# Java Tutorial Series

To find the youtube series in which we create this content, go to https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO3dEwPigFryXnspQfT7iBgjh4N9bYGP3. Also, subscribe to CodeYourPassion, where I teach you how to implement your ideas in code, allowing you to combine your knowledge and interests with CS.

**The goal:** I believe anyone can learn programming if they put in the time and effort. If you follow along with the tutorial and experiment, you also should be able to join the programming realm.

## Accessing the code for each lesson

If you go under the branches section of the github repository, you should see that there are branches for each lesson that we learnt. Press on the branch to access the code from that specific lesson.

## Downloading the tools

There are multiple different tools that are required for you to follow along with the programming, which I highly suggest you do. Here's the list:

- **Java JDK:** You must have the java JDK actually installed to follow along. To download it, go to https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html and download the latest version. If you are on linux like me and you want to install it from the terminal, you can find many results on how to do so on Google.
- **Java IDE:** An IDE is an interface that you can program and run code on. I am using the VS Code editor that you can download from https://code.visualstudio.com/. Any editor would work, however. There are different IDEs like Eclipse, Netbeans, and Intellij IDEA that will give you the same performance and functionality.
  - **VS Code tips:** If you are using VS Code, here are some of the extensions that I use:
    - Java extension pack
    - Bearded theme(Black and gold)
    - Better comments
    - Bracket Pair Colorizer 2
    - Error lens
    - Vim

**Once again, remember, it is important to experiment and try your own projects. You will definetely fail but it is the process of coming out of the difficult area that is essential for your growth**

Good luck
